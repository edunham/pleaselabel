Please License
==============

In theory, this is supposed to be a pretty-ish website where you put in a
github username and it makes some API calls and looks at that user's public
repos and lists which ones have a file whose name starts with LICENSE and
which ones don't. 

My design goal is to have everything run on the client side.
